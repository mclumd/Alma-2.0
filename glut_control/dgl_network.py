# Define Model
# ------------
#
# This tutorial will build a two-layer `Graph Convolutional Network
# (GCN) <http://tkipf.github.io/graph-convolutional-networks/>`__. Each of
# its layer computes new node representations by aggregating neighbor
# information. If you have gone through the
# :doc:`introduction <1_introduction>`, you will notice two
# differences:
#
# -  Since the task is to predict a single category for the *entire graph*
#    instead of for every node, you will need to aggregate the
#    representations of all the nodes and potentially the edges to form a
#    graph-level representation. Such process is more commonly referred as
#    a *readout*. A simple choice is to average the node features of a
#    graph with ``dgl.mean_nodes()``.
#
# -  The input graph to the model will be a batched graph yielded by the
#    ``GraphDataLoader``. The readout functions provided by DGL can handle
#    batched graphs so that they will return one representation for each
#    minibatch element.
